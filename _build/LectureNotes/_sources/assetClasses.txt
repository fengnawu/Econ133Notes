Asset Classes
=============

Introduction
============
What is an investment?

.. rst-class:: to-build

- A commitment of resources with the expectation of a future payoff.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Financial investments: stocks, bonds, options, futures.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Other investments: education, physical fitness, relationships.

.. rst-class:: to-build

Decisions faces by investors:

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Risk-return trade-off.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Efficient pricing of financial assets.


Real vs. Financial Assets
=========================
Real assets are goods (generally tangible) that are used to produce
other goods or services: buildings, machines, land, knowledge.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Productivity of economy determined by real assets.

.. rst-class:: to-build

Financial assets are claims to income generated by real assets.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Firms use the money raised through financial assets to invest in
  plants, equipment, labor, etc.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Holder of financial asset receives a portion of the resulting
  returns from real assets.

.. rst-class:: to-build

While real assets determine wealth, financial assets determine
distribution of wealth.


Equity Assets
=============
Equity (stock) is an ownership claim in a particular firm.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Equity holder owns a prorated share of the real assets of a firm and
  is entitled to a portion of the profits that is not reinvested
  (dividends).

.. rst-class:: to-build

- The return to an equity asset is not guaranteed: it is tied to the
  financial well-being of the firm.


Equity Example
==============
Consider `The Coca-Cola Company <http://bit.ly/1ckSWAC>`_.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- On 14 Jan 2014, there were 4.42 billion shares of KO
  outstanding.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- On 28 Nov 2013, KO decided to pay $1.24 billion in dividends to
  shareholders.

.. rst-class:: to-build

  - This amounted to $0.28 paid to each share.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- If the company were liquidated, each share would entitle the holder
  to 1/4,420,000,000 of all KO assets.


Equity Prices
=============
There are several ways to think about the price of an equity share.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Add the values of all firm assets and divide by the number of shares
  outstanding.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Alternatively, it is the `present value
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value>`_ of all future
  payments (dividends).

.. rst-class:: to-build

.. math::

   P = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{D_t}{(1+r)^t}

.. rst-class:: to-build

- :math:`D_t` represents the dividend payment at future date
  :math:`t`, and :math:`r` is the competitive interest rate that you could otherwise earn on your money.



Present Value
=============
Recall that present value is a way to value future payments in current
terms.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Money paid to you in the future should be less than money paid now.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Why?

Present Value
=============
Suppose you can earn 10% interest on every dollar you save tonight.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Then if you save $0.9091 tonight, it will be worth
  $0.9091 :math:`\times` 1.1 = $1 tomorrow.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- If I offer you either $0.92 today or $1 tomorrow, which would you
  pick?

.. rst-class:: to-build

- If I offer you either $0.90 today or $1 tomorrow, which would you
  pick?


Fixed Income Assets
===================
Fixed income securities are assets with payments determined by a
formula (e.g. bonds).

.. rst-class:: to-build

- U.S. Treasury bills/bonds, commercial paper, CDs.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Although fixed income payments are determined
  mathematically there is still risk (interest rate risk, default
  risk).

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Longer maturity fixed income assets tend to be more risky.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Fixed income is typically less risky than equity because the
  payments are guaranteed.


Fixed Income Assets
===================
- Fixed income assets are typically a way for firms or governments to
  borrow money.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- It is possible to hold both equity and debt (fixed income) assets
  for the same firm.


Fixed Income Prices
===================
Fixed income assets typically promise a stream of payments at future
dates.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Coupon payments at regular intervals.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- A final principal payment (face value) at the end.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- The price of a fixed income asset is the present value of these
  payments.

.. rst-class:: to-build

.. math::

   P = \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t} + \frac{F}{(1+r)^T}.


Derivatives
===========
Derivatives are assets whose payoffs are determined by another
(underlying) asset.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Options are assets which allow the holder the option to buy or sell
  an asset at a pre-specified price at a future date.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Futures are contracts to buy and sell assets (real or financial) for
  a pre-specified price at a future date.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- These assets are called derivatives because their value derives from
  the value of the underlying asset.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Derivatives are commonly used for hedging (insurance) but are
  sometimes used for speculation, too.
