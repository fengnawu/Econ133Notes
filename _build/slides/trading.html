<h2>Electronic Trading</h2>
<p>In the 1990s, several electronic exchanges were developed.</p>
<ul class="to-build simple">

<h2>High-Frequency Trading</h2>
<p>Originally electronic systems were simply used for quoting and
displaying prices.</p>
<ul class="to-build simple">
<li>Trades were still executed by hand on the trading floor.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="to-build simple">
<li>Eventually, traders started placing orders electronically.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="to-build simple">
<li>This led to <em>algorithmic trading</em>: traders not only submitted
orders electronically, but wrote software algorithms that
executed trades intelligently, depending on market conditions.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="to-build simple">
<li>Algorithmic trading has resulted in very fast execution, commonly
referred to as <em>high-frequency trading</em>.</li>
